# Design System: 29-repo-showcase

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows an **Enterprise Tech / Curated Gallery** aesthetic. It uses a "Circuit Slate" foundation with "Electric Cyan" (#06B6D4) technical accents, focusing on grid precision, depth perception, and technical authority.

## Design Patterns
-   **Neo-Cards**: Elevated glass containers with variable layout-id glows and high-fidelity internal borders.
-   **Circuit Background**: Specialized background pattern using radial gradients and line-work to signify a "Mainframe" environment.
-   **Enterprise Header**: High-contrast, high-blur navigation (H-24) with black-to-cyan typographical gradients.
-   **Tech HUD**: Specialized icon-containers with dedicated color-token alignment for each core technology in the stack.

## Color Palette
-   **Mainframe Slate**: Primary Background (#020617)
-   **Electric Cyan**: Primary Action & Brand (#06B6D4)
-   **Circuit Fade**: Secondary Purple Glare (#A855F7)
-   **Neutral Text**: Accessible slate hierarchy (White to Slate-500)

## Interaction Design
-   **Layout Glow**: Motion-driven background glares that track the active hovered index across the tech stack grid.
-   **Hero Kinematics**: 800ms duration translate-scale animations for the primary typographical blocks.
-   **Card Kinetics**: Recursive hover states that trigger internal scale and border-color transitions to signify technical focus.
